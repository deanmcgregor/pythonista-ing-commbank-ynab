# Commmbank/ING Import Script for YNAB

This script imports CSV files from ING Australia and the Commonwealth Bank to YNAB using their API. 

It is designed to be used with Pythonista on iOS. The script is set up so that you can use the iOS sharing interface with Pythonista to call this script.
That should allow you to grab a CSV from the web and auto-import it into YNAB.
